Issues
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, total time for the program to run is close to 30-40 sec
in first one or two run. After that it is close to 7 sec.

user time is nearly constant in first run or any other run however
system time is quite large in the first run which increases the 
total time thereafter. I am not really sure why that is happening.
It might be MMU is taking a lot of time in the first cold start
due to heavy malloc usage in the program
